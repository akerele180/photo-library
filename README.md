# Photo Library App

Hey guys ðŸ‘‹ this Photo Library App is built using Next.js and Cloudinary. 

Note: It is a tutorial follow-up with a touch of my ingenuity.

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To get started, first create your new application by running the command below:

```
npx create-next-app@latest -e https://github.com/akerele180/photo-library.git my-photo-library
```

> Tip: Alternatively, you can clone this repository, but running the above command helps with some additional tasks like resetting git history and installing dependencies!
